Learn slowly, forget slowly
Writing is better than reading.
When reading, official is better than unofficial.
Bad code is better than no code.
Mistakes are better than no mistakes.
The first step to fixing a problem is admission.
Community is better than solitude.
Comments, comments, comments.
Experiment, experiment, experiment.
